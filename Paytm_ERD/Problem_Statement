Problem Statement: Design a database schema for a banking app using the E-R model and design tables accordingly using the relationship model. The necessary information is given below :

Entities : Accounts, Customer, Branches
Each customer must have an account. Joint accounts are allowed.
A customer can have multiple accounts in different branch, but not in same branch.
A branch can have many accounts.

Assume columns accordingly and mention primary keys, weak and strong entities.

According to the given information, here is a database schema designed using the Entity-Relationship (E-R) model for a banking app(Paytm):

Table: Accounts(Strong entity)

account_number (Primary Key)
customer_id (Foreign Key referencing Customer)
branch_id (Foreign Key referencing Branches)

Table: Branches(Strong entity)

branch_id (Primary Key)
branch_name
branch_address

Table: Customer(Strong entity)

customer_id (Primary Key)
customer_name
customer_address

Note: The above schema allows joint accounts since multiple accounts can be associated with a single customer.
