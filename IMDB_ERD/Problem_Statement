Problem statement: Design a database schema for a movie and tv series database using the E-R model and design tables accordingly using the relationship model. The necessary information is given below :

Entities : Movie, Actors, TV series
A TV series or a movie must have an actor. An actor can act in both.

Assume columns accordingly and mention primary keys, weak and strong entities.

By doing analysis of above system we observe:

Relationships:

Many-to-Many Relationship between Movie and Actor:

A movie can have multiple actors.
An actor can act in multiple movies.
Many-to-Many Relationship between TV Series and Actor:

A TV series can have multiple actors.
An actor can act in multiple TV series.
To implement the above schema in the relational model, we can create the following tables:

Table: Movie(Strong entity)

MovieID (Primary Key)
Title
ReleaseDate
Genre
Director

Table: Actor(Strong entity)

ActorID (Primary Key)
ActorName
BirthDate
Nationality


Table: MovieActor

MovieID (Foreign Key referencing Movie table)
ActorID (Foreign Key referencing Actor table)
PRIMARY KEY (MovieID, ActorID)

Table: TVSeries(Strong entity)

SeriesID (Primary Key)
Title
ReleaseDate
Genre
Director

Table: TVSeriesActor 

SeriesID (Foreign Key referencing TVSeries table)
ActorID (Foreign Key referencing Actor table)
PRIMARY KEY (SeriesID, ActorID)

Here, MovieActor and TVSeriesActor are weak entities that depend on the existence of both Movie/TV Series and Actor.
