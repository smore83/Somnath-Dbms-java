Design a database schema for railway ticket booking using the E-R model and design tables accordingly using the relationship model. The necessary information is given below :

Entities : Train, Ticket, Customer
Ticket can be reserved or unreserved.
Each reserved ticket must correspond to a train and a customer.
Each unreserved ticket must correspond to a customer.
A customer cannot be in two trains at the same time.
Assume columns accordingly and mention primary keys, weak and strong entities.

Based on the given information, we can design a database schema for railway ticket booking(IRCTC) using the Entity-Relationship (E-R) model.

Step1: Find all entities & thier relationship.

Entities: Train, Ticket, Customer

Relationships: Reserved Ticket, Unreserved Ticket


Primary keys are denoted with an asterisk (*), and foreign keys are denoted with a caret (^).
Weak entities are indicated within square brackets [].

Train(Train_ID(PK), Train_Name, Departure_Time, Arrival_Time, ...other_details)

Ticket(Ticket_ID(PK), Ticket_Type, Customer_ID, Train_ID(FK), ...other_details)

Customer(Customer_ID(PK), Customer_Name, Customer_Address, ...other_details)

Reserved Ticket

Unreserved Ticket

Explanation:

The "Train" entity represents information about each train, including its unique ID, name, 
departure time, arrival time, and any other relevant attributes.

The "Ticket" entity represents individual tickets, which can be either reserved or unreserved. 
It includes a unique ticket ID, ticket type (reserved or unreserved), customer ID, train ID, and other attributes such as seat number, fare, etc.

The "Customer" entity stores information about customers, including their unique ID, name, address, and other relevant details.

The "Reserved Ticket" relationship indicates that a reserved ticket must correspond to a customer and a train.
It is represented as a weak entity since it depends on both the "Ticket" and "Customer" entities.

The "Unreserved Ticket" relationship indicates that an unreserved ticket must correspond to a customer.
It is also represented as a weak entity since it depends on the "Ticket" entity.

The "Ticket" entity references the "Customer" entity through the Customer_ID attribute, and it references the "Train" entity through the Train_ID attribute.

This database schema allows for the storage of information related to trains, tickets, and customers while maintaining the relationships between them.
It ensures that each reserved ticket corresponds to a specific train and customer, and each unreserved ticket corresponds to a customer.
It also enforces the constraint that a customer cannot be in two trains simultaneously.
