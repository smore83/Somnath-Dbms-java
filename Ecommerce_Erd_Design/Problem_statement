Problem Statement: Design a database schema for an e-commerce app using the E-R model and design tables accordingly using the relationship model. The necessary information is given below :

Entities : Supplier, Customer, Items, Order
Every item should correspond to a supplier. One supplier can have more than one items.
A customer can have one order at the same time. One order can have multiple items from multiple brands.

Assume columns accordingly and mention primary keys, weak and strong entities.

Solution: 


Based on the given information, we can design a database for the e-commerce app using the Entity-Relationship (E-R) model.

First we identify the entities & relationships from the given problem statement.

Entities: Supplier ,Customer,Item,Order


Relationships:

One-to-Many Relationship between Supplier and Item:

One supplier can have multiple items.
One item can be associated with only one supplier.

One-to-Many Relationship between Customer and Order:
One customer can have multiple orders.
One order can be placed by only one customer.

Many-to-Many Relationship between Item and Order:
One order can have multiple items.
One item can be associated with multiple orders.

To implement the above schema in the relational model, we have to create the following tables:


Table: Supplier(Strong entity)

SupplierID (Primary Key)
SupplierName
SupplierAddress
SupplierContact


Table: Customer(Strong entity)

CustomerID (Primary Key)
CustomerName
CustomerAddress
CustomerContact


Table: Item(Strong entity)

ItemID (Primary Key)
ItemName
SupplierID (Foreign Key referencing Supplier table)
Price
Quantity


Table: Order_details(Strong entity)

OrderID (Primary Key)
CustomerID (Foreign Key referencing Customer table)
OrderDate
TotalAmount


Table: OrderItem(Weak entity)

OrderID (Foreign Key referencing Order table)
ItemID (Foreign Key referencing Item table)
Quantity
